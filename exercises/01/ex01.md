**PBPL210 Fall 2021**  
**Exercise 01: Curriculumn Vitae**  
**Due: 2021-10-13 17:00** 


## Introduction
In this exercise you will be developing your [curriculumn vitae][cv] using open source tools in JupyterHub. The goal is to have a single source document that you can use to produce for different target outputs:

- pdf
- html
- docx

In other words, you need only update the source document when you have new items, and the targets will be updated automatically. *There is no need to create the pdf, html, or docx files by hand each time you add information*.

## Learning Outcomes

- Use open source tools to create [reproducible workflows]
- Create, manipulate and leverage [text files]
- Develop experience with [Markdown][md] and [pandoc] for producing documents


## Instructions

1. Read the [Resources](#resources) provided at the end of this document.
1. Using Jupyterhub and either the built-in editor or [nano] create a [Markdown][md] source document called `cv.md`. Following the [examples][cv], populate this source document with your own information. 
2. In the [terminal], use [nano] to create a [Makefile]. The makefile must have **targets** to produce the following outputs for your cv: `pdf`, `html`, and `docx`. These output files should be named: `cv.pdf`, `cv.html` and `cv.docx`.

### What to Submit
On the canvas site, you need to submit the following files for evaluation on this exercise:

- `Makefile`
- `cv.md`
- `cv.pdf`
- `cv.html`
- `cv.docx`
